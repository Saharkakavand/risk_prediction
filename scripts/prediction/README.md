# Prediction
- this directory contains code for both batch and td prediction
- batch prediction is where a dataset is collected using monte carlo method, and then a predictor is fit to that dataset
- td stands for temporal difference, and this type of prediction iteratively builds up a predictor over time, and does not naturally produce a dataset
- see the respective readme files for more information
